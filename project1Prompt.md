### Overview

The time has come to build your own game! This is your chance to **be creative** work through some really **tough programming challenges**, and show off the wealth of knowledge you've gained this last three weeks.


You will be working **individually** for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* **Implement the project using Javascript class objects**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (gh-pages)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet (gh-pages)
* **A ``README.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to the live version, screenshots of the game, pictures of wireframes, installation, instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Wireframe Your Game**</br> Break down the logic/visual into individual components (data, views, style, DOM manipulation) using whiteboards!

* **Use your Development Tools**</br>
 (console.log, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

* **Commit early, commit often.**</br>
When you `git commit -m ""` it saves the current version of your code. The best policy is to commit your code after each new feature is added. This is especially important in this project. If you don't commit and your app breaks, you have NO saved copy of the working code. Super bummer! So add, commit, push!

* **Consult documentation resources**</br>
 Before talking to your Squad Leader, see the <a href="askingForHelp.md">Asking For Help </a> doc for proper the procedure. You **must** use all available documentation and resources to solve your own problems (MDN, Stack Overflow, etc.).

### Potential Project Ideas

#### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people can win big by guessing which card the computer will deal next!  Start with the Ace equalling 1 or 11... not both.  Once that is 100% working, you can work to make the Ace value changeable.  

#### Self-scoring Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

#### Connect Four
Make up your own implementation of a popular game using Javascipt!  
Connect 4 is a 2 player game where each player in his turn drops one of his checkers down any of the slots in the top of the grid. The play alternates until one of the players gets four checkers of his color in a row, he is the winner.

### Useful Resources

* **[MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)** _( for all things you should reference .. MDN .. ALL the time! )_
* **[jQuery Docs](http://api.jquery.com)** _(if you're using jQuery)_
* **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_
* **[ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations)** _(eslint docs)_
* **[ESLint config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)** _( eslint configuration .. just in case)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation
When your project is submitted, you will be evaluated on the following aspects:

* __Project Workflow__: Did you wireframe your game and follow the proper commit procedure (we will look over this in detail)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements (see above)? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class (AirBnb), such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

  |Score | Expectations |
  |----- |:------------:|
  |**0** |  Incomplete. |
  |**1** | Does not meet expectations.|
  |**2** | Meets expectations, good job!|
  |**3** | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!|

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
